# Nuclei Templates for RootMe

This script is used to solve the challenges of the [RootMe](https://www.root-me.org/) platform.

## Disclaimer

This project is done to practice automation and to learn more about some tools, to be able to extend it with more real situations. Do not use it on challenges you didn't solve yourself.

## How to use

1. Connect to the rootme website and get the challenge number (as in the url)
2. Run `./solver.sh --all` to solve all the challenges
3. Or run `./solver.sh <challenge_number>` to solve only one challenge

You can specify tools that you don't want to use, ... Everything is detailled if you run `./solver.sh --help`
